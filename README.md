# Shapertools Projects for Origin

This repository holds my current attempt to find a good way to program the creation of the SVG which is read by the Origin.

## SVG files

Created with the SVG library [svg.py](https://github.com/orsinium-labs/svg.py) to programmatically draw image used in my ShaperTools projects. These files are under MIT license.

### Mighty Wallet

Python program generating a SVG file to cut a template based on the Mighty wallet design I like a lot.
